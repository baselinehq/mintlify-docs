## Prerequisites
Before you begin, you will need to have the following:
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)


### Prometheus

If you do not have prometheus-server installed on your cluster, you can use the installation guide below:

- Add the chart to deploy prometheus on the cluster.
```shell
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
```

<Accordion title="Existing Prometheus installations">

If you already have Prometheus running in your cluster, you can skip these installation steps and proceed directly to the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

In your Helm `values.yaml`, set the `prometheus_endpoint` to your existing Prometheus URL.

For example, if you're using the **kube-prometheus-stack**, the endpoint is typically:

```yaml
prometheus_endpoint: http://kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus.kube-prometheus-stack.svc:9090
```

</Accordion>

- Install the operator to begin collecting metrics for workloads on the cluster.
```shell
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus --namespace prometheus-system --create-namespace
kubectl wait --for=condition=available --timeout=10m -n prometheus-system deploy/prometheus-server
```

### Obtain an API Key

To run the CostGraph operator, you will need to create an account on [costgraph.baselinehq.cloud](https://costgraph.baselinehq.cloud/) to obtain an API key.

### Setup a plan

Once you obtain an API key, setup a plan to allow the API key to have billing enabled.

<Warning>
Setting up a plan

You must have a plan setup for your organization to use the operator. Not doing so will cause the operator to fail on startup.
</Warning>

<Tip>Free Plan Available For Developers</Tip>

There's a free plan available on the `One-Time` tab to begin using CostGraph without any payment.

<img height="400" src="/images/billing.png" />

### Helm configuration

In deploying the CostGraph operator, the charts are available in the GitHub repository [costgraph-charts](https://github.com/BaselineHQ/costgraph-charts)

Run the helm command below to import the charts into the repository to begin deploying the operator.

```shell
helm repo add costgraph https://baselinehq.github.io/costgraph-charts/
helm repo update
```

## Configuration

### CostGraph
Create a configuration file with the helm updates that are required in deploying the package

```yaml
domain: <your-company-subdomain>
costgraph:
  config:
    costgraph_instance_name: <instance-name>
    prometheus_endpoint: <prometheus-address>
    api_key: <your-api-key>
```

<Tip>Using Multiple Cost Centers</Tip>

If you have an existing CostGraph instance, you can configure replication to that cost center by appending the relevant cluster names to the `costgraph_instance_master_domains` configuration.

You can append multiple clusters to the configuration, this will be the `costgraph_instance_name` of the instance you want to view costs from.

```yaml
costgraph:
  config:
    costgraph_instance_master_domains:
      - name: "<cluster-to-replicate-to>"
```

### Expected Utilisation Percentages

If you want to configure expected utilisation percentages for recommendations on the CostGraph instance, you can change it using the following configuration:

```yaml
costgraph:
  config:
    expected_utilisation_percent:
      cpu: 80
      memory: 80
```

By default, the expected utilisation is set to 80% for both CPU and Memory. You can change this to your desired value.

### Superset
To configure the superset credentials, update the configuration for the superset setting.

```yaml
costgraph:
  config:
    superset_admin_username: admin
    superset_admin_password: admin
```

### Postgres

<Warning>Postgres Configuration</Warning>

Only use this if you have an existing postgres instance or manage a Postgres instance outside Kubernetes eg AWS Aurora etc.

If you want to use an existing database instance, add in this configuration

```yaml
postgres:
  enabled: false
  config:
    postgres_db: postgres
    postgres_user: username
    postgres_password: password
    pg_data_directory: /var/lib/postgresql/data
    postgres_host: db_hostname
    postgres_port: db_port
```

If you want to have a PVC for the database, set the pvc configuration to `true` and update the size for the PVC.

<Note>This will create a StatefulSet for the database instance and does not directly configure a PVC for the database.</Note>

```yaml
postgres:
    pvc:
      enabled: true
      size: 10Gi
```

## Deployment
Finally deploy the configuration with the updated settings for your CostGraph instance

```shell
helm install costgraph costgraph/costgraph -f <values-file>
```

## Post Deployment

In the tabs below, you will find features available to you after the helm deployment is complete and resources are provisioned successfully.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Accessing Superset">
    <Tip>Superset Credentials</Tip>

    Unless modified, the username and password for the superset instance is `admin` and `admin`

    Once the deployment is complete, you can access the CostGraph dashboard on the domain `costgraph.$domain` and login with the credentials provided in the configuration file.

    ### Accessing the dashboard 

    Ensure that the domain is accessible from the network you are connecting from. If you are using a local cluster, you can use the `kubectl port-forward` command to access the dashboard.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Port Forwarding">
        The quickest way to access the dashboard is to use port forwarding. This will forward the port `8088` on your local machine to the port `80` on the CostGraph service.
        ```shell
        python -m webbrowser -t http://localhost:8088
        kubectl port-forward -n costgraph svc/costgraph 8088:80
        ```
        
        You can then access the dashboard on `localhost:8088` in your browser.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Ingress">
        If you have an ingress controller installed, you can access the dashboard using the ingress controller's URL.

        For users of `nginx-ingress`, you can use the following command to get the ingress controller's URL:

        ```yaml
        apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
        kind: Ingress
        metadata:
          name: costgraph
          namespace: costgraph
        spec:
          ingressClassName: nginx
          rules:
          - host: costgraph.<your-domain>
            http:
              paths:
              - path: /
                pathType: Prefix
                backend:
                  service:
                    name: costgraph
                    port:
                      number: 80
        ```   

        <Tip>Ingress Annotations</Tip>
        For kubernetes version < 1.18 or traefik v1 (chart 1.x â€“ 2.x) use the `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation to specify the ingress class.
      </Tab>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Prometheus Metrics">
    The operator comes pre-installed with a prometheus server allowing you to view metrics as available on the database in the prometheus dashboard.

    <Note>Exposing Prometheus Metrics</Note>
        
    You must have service auto-discovery enabled for kubernetes services to have the operator metrics scraped by the prometheus server.

    <Note>If you installed prometheus-server using this guide, you have auto-discovery enabled by default for kubernetes services.</Note>

    If you do not see any targets with `costgraph`, the scrape configuration will need to be manually added as a static target to your prometheus instance.

    ```yaml
    - job_name: 'costgraph'
    honor_labels: true
    scrape_interval: 1m
    scrape_timeout: 10s
    metrics_path: /metrics
    scheme: http
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['costgraph.costgraph:9090']
    ```

    All metrics are prefixed with the `costgraph_` prefix and can be viewed for your usage in Grafana, Perses or your preferred dashboard tool.

    <img height="400" src="/images/prometheus.png" />
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Grafana Dashboard">
    Once you have the operator running, you can install the Grafana dashboard to view the metrics in a more user-friendly format. The Grafana dashboard is available in the [costgraph-manifests](https://github.com/baselinehq/costgraph-manifests) repository.
