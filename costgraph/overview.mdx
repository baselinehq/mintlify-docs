# What is Costgraph?
Costgraph is a data driven FinOps tool that provides realtime usage information for modern organisations.


## What does it do?
Costgraph is a data driven FinOps operator that provides realtime usage information for modern organisations.

It aims to:
1. Provide critical insights for distributed application performance and cost alignment.
2. Simplify the operations landscape around existing tooling choices.
3. Provide a data neutral interface for developers to build tooling.
4. Remove barriers between infrastructure and application teams to own cost efforts.

Costgraph aims to replace in the future:
1. The need for VPA bloat with tooling centered on metrics-server and several other kubernetes tooling.
2. Data tooling across various vendors already providing cost information in less useful modes.
3. Difficulty for teams looking to perform cost and resource rightsizing efforts for their organisations.

To get started, deploy the operator and get started on our cost improvement journey.
