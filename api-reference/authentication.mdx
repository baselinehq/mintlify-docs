# Authentication

Some endpoints such as the [recommendations endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/recommendations) require authentication. Follow these steps to get started:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Obtain an API Key">
    To use the API, you'll need an API key. Create an account on [costgraph.baselinehq.cloud](https://costgraph.baselinehq.cloud/) to obtain your API key.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Request File">
    Create a file named `rec.json` with the following content:

    ```json
    {
      "region": "nyc1",
      "provider": "digitalocean",
      "instance_type": "s-4vcpu-16gb-amd",
      "operating_system": "linux",
      "service": "Droplet",
      "usage_type": "ondemand",
      "availability_zone": "",
      "predicates": {
        "usage_types": ["ondemand"]
      },
      "vm": {
        "cpu_cores": 4,
        "ram_gb": 16
      },
      "usage": {
        "cpu_cores": 3,
        "ram_gb": 5
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make the Request">
    Use curl to make the request to the recommendations endpoint:

    ```bash
    curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
         -XPOST https://pricing.baselinehq.cloud/recommendations \
         -d@rec.json
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using the API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of your requests:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the API key you obtained from the dashboard.


## Example Usage

Here's a complete example using curl:

```bash
# Store your API key in an environment variable
export COSTGRAPH_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Make an authenticated request
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $COSTGRAPH_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -XPOST https://pricing.baselinehq.cloud/recommendations \
     -d@rec.json
```

## Errors

If authentication fails, you'll receive a 401 Unauthorized response:

```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
}
```
