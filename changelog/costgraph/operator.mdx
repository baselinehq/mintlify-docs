# Changelogs
Releases for the CostGraph operator will have helm tags associated that are not tied to the release version. Across helm versions within a major or minor release, patch updates will be made for hotfixes, bugs and business focused updates. Helm release notes are available on our [chart repository](https://github.com/BaselineHQ/costgraph-charts), view the helm [index.yaml](https://baselinehq.github.io/costgraph-charts/index.yaml) to find information about the latest releases.

## SLA
- We will provide changelogs for major and minor releases of the operator.
- Customers will be made aware of any breaking changes in any release cycle.
- We aim to provide releases on a regular basis for customer features and business priorities.
- All related tag updates will be made under a helm release, no update is needed from customers for operator dependencies.

<Update label="2025-06-03" description="v0.1.0">
  ### Breaking Changes
  - Due to the deployment of our new pricing infrastructure, customers using the raw pricing data will see schema changes. As much as we attempt to provide a standard schema, this change was unavoidable. This change is limited to customers developing with the data from our operator, no changes will be observed for dashboard and prometheus experiences.

  ### Updates
  - Deployment of a new pricing infrastructure bringing improved operator performance with lower latency 
  - Updates to the savings dashboard to show more than 5 entries previously causing customers to miss relatively smaller container resources
  - Improved pricing updates supporting newer cloud instance types and various usage types such as spot and reserved
  - Addition of per-CPU and per-Memory pricing for all cloud providers improving the Cost Driver dashboard experience
  - Support for newer GCP instance types and their upcoming Sweden region release
  - Addition of liveness and readiness probe endpoints for customer visibility on failed instance deployments
  - Hotfix for GCP custom instance types deviating from standard pricing obtained from cloud providers
  - Hotfix for AZ based AWS spot pricing on Opt-In regions 
  - Support for all regional DigitalOcean pricing information providing customers more value for this provider
  - Future support for resource pricing updates in Storage, Network, GPUs and related resource types
